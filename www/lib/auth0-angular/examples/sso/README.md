This example shows how to use SSO with Angular. The most important thing is to activate SSO on `authProvider` options. [Check this](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular/blob/master/examples/sso/scripts/myApp.js#L24-L34)

Also, you can check out [more information about SSO here](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular#using-sso)
